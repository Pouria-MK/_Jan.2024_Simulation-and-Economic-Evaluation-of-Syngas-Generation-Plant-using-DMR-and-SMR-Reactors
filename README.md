# Simulation and Economic Evaluation of Syngas Generation Plant Using DMR/SMR Reactors and Carbon Capture Unit

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive study, simulation, and economic evaluation of a syngas generation plant utilizing Dry Methane Reforming (DMR) and Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) reactors, coupled with a carbon capture unit. The study begins with an analysis of the global and Middle Eastern syngas markets, followed by a detailed explanation of the rationale behind using DMR and SMR reactors to achieve the optimal hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio in syngas production.

The project encompasses a thorough investigation of reactor sensitivity to temperature and pressure variations, visualized through detailed analyses. A complete Process Flow Diagram (PFD) is developed, including conceptual process diagrams both with and without the carbon capture unit, elucidating its role in the overall process.

The simulation, conducted using Aspen HYSYS, addresses key challenges such as convergence issues, fluid package selection for the carbon capture unit, identification and resolution of reference PFD inconsistencies, and scale-up considerations. The project further includes comprehensive equipment sizing and costing estimations for all major units.

The economic feasibility study employs the Lang method to calculate direct production costs, fixed charges, and general expenses. This analysis provides insights into the plant's economic viability and sensitivity to various factors.

Throughout the project, visualization and documentation were accomplished using Microsoft Office suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and Visio, ensuring clear and professional presentation of findings.

This project demonstrates advanced capabilities in process simulation, design, and economic analysis of complex chemical engineering systems, showcasing proficiency in industry-standard tools and methodologies.
